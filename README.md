# CoupBot
Telegram Bot that allows you to play Coup in Telegram groups.

The bot currently runs as @TheCoupBot.

To run the bot yourself, you will need:

Python (tested with 3.6+)
The python-telegram-bot module (tested with 8.0+)

Get a bot token from @BotFather and change <TOKEN> in shared_vars.py.
Install requirements (using a virtualenv is recommended): pip install -r requirements.txt
Then run the bot with python3 bot.py.

Code documentation is minimal but there.
